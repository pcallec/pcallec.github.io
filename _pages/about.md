I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma working in the [Dr Chongle Pan](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=m2ORdeYAAAAJ&hl=en)([PanLab](https://www.thepanlab.com/)). My research covers applying machine learning to Medical Imaging and Natural Language Processing(NLP) for Data Augmentation of messages in Health applications.

[Dr Qinggong Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UVnZQlMAAAAJ&hl=en)([Biophotonic Imaging Laboratory](http://tanglab.oucreate.com/)) is one of my collaborators. He is using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images and exploring new applications for his instruments e.g. kidney tissue detection, epidural space detection among others.
