I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma working in the [Dr Chongle Pan](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=m2ORdeYAAAAJ&hl=en)([PanLab](https://www.thepanlab.com/)). My research covers utilizing machine learning for Health applications. One collaboration involves using Natural Language Processing(NLP) for Data Augmentation of messages for smoking cessation. This project in collaboration with [TSET Helath Promotion Research Center](https://healthpromotionresearch.org/).

Another collaboration with [Dr Qinggong Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UVnZQlMAAAAJ&hl=en)([Biophotonic Imaging Laboratory](http://tanglab.oucreate.com/)) involves  the use of Computer Vision. Dr. Tang is developing new instruments using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for new applications in kidney tissue detection, epidural space detection among others.
